Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is writting instructions [called code] for computers whereby apps, games and websites are biult. it is important because it solves real life's problems eg fix bugs, write code that makes things work smoothly and design apps and systems that users love.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
python,java,java script- this are programming languages
VsCode- this is a code editor
Version control [Git]- keeps track

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-this define objective, identify resources and assess risk and create mitigation strategy
Requirement analysis- create software requirements specification document
Design-create system architecture and database design

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
FEATURE                 WATERFALL                             AGILE
Approach                Sequintal and stuctured               Lterative and flexible
Flexibility             Rigid;no changes after phases         Highly adaptable to changes
Customer involvement    Minimal, mostly at the end            Continous involvement at the end
Time to market          Long; product delivered at the end    Short;incremental release

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
A software developer is responsible for designing, coding and maintaining softwar applications.They are also responsible for; writing and testing code, Debugging and troubleshooting,Software design and architecture, collaboration with other teams,optimizing performance.
QUALITY ASSURANCE[QA] ENGINEER
QA engineer ensures that software is free from defects and meets quality standards before release. They are responsible for; Testing software, writing test case abd plans,Performance and security testing, Bug reporting and tracking, ensuring compliance.
PROJECT MANAGER[PM]
The PM oversees the software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget and meets besiness goals.They are responsible for; Project planning and Scheduling, Team coordinating and communication, Risk management, Budget and resource management, Tracking Progress and Reporting.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is a software application that provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for writting, debugging and managing code in a single interface. Its importance is that it increses productivity, it detects errors and dubbugs, and it helps in code management and organization. Examples are ; Visual studio code, JetBrains InteLLiJ IDEA, Eclipse, PyCharm.
VCS tracks changes to code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate while maintaining a history of modifications.Examples are ;Git, GitHUb, GitLub, Bitbucket.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing tight deadline and project pressure- Apply time management techniques like pomodoro technique to stay productive.
Debugging and fixing complex bugs- Use debugging tools like breakpoints,logs and profilers to trace issues.
Keeping up with rapidly changing technologies- Follow tech blogs, online courses and podcasts.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.UNIT TESTING; It tests individual components in isolation and it is important because it detects errors early reducing development costs.
2.INTERGRATION; It ensures different modules or systems interact correctly. It is important because it identifies issues in module communication before full system testing.
3.SYSTEM; It tests and completes software application to validate overall functionality. It is important because it confirms that the system meets business and user requirements.
4.ACCEPTANCE; It end-users test the system to verify if it meets their needs. It is important because it ensures that the product is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with Ai models.Its importance is that it Enhances AI accuracy and reduces misinterpretation and it improves responce quality.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about Earth" TO "Give a brief overview of Earth's geography, atmosphere and key characteristics". It is more effective because it has a clear focus rather than the first one which would have required the AI feature to cover everything.
